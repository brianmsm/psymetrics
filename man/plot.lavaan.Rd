\title{Plot Method for lavaan Objects}
\usage{
\method{plot}{lavaan}(x, type = "factor_loadings", standardized = TRUE, CI = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{lavaan} model object.}

\item{type}{A character string indicating the type of plot to generate. Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"factor_loadings"}: Generates a dot plot of standardized factor loadings, optionally including confidence intervals.
\item \code{"residuals"}: Generates a residual plot to visualize the differences between observed and model-implied covariances.
\item \code{"path"}: Generates a path diagram representing the model structure, showing the relationships between latent and observed variables.
}}

\item{standardized}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, uses standardized estimates for factor loadings. Only applicable when \code{type = "factor_loadings"}. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{CI}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, includes confidence intervals in the factor loading plot. Only applicable when \code{type = "factor_loadings"}. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the specific plotting functions.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object for \code{factor_loadings} and \code{residuals} plots if \code{ggplot2} is installed, or a \code{semPlot} diagram object for \code{path} plots. An error message will be returned if required packages are not available.
}
\description{
This is a plot method for objects of class \code{lavaan}. It allows users to create different types of plots to visualize key aspects of \code{lavaan} models, including factor loadings, residuals, and path diagrams.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Factor Loadings Plot}: Displays a dot plot of factor loadings, with items on the y-axis and loadings on the x-axis. Confidence intervals can be added if desired.
\item \strong{Residuals Plot}: Shows the residuals (differences between observed and model-implied covariances), typically as a heatmap or scatterplot.
\item \strong{Path Diagram}: Illustrates the structure of the model, showing latent variables, observed variables, and the estimated relationships between them.
